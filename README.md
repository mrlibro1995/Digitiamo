# Digitiamo Challenge Application
Welcome to the Digitiamo Challenge Application! This web application is designed to demonstrate the integration of Flask (Python) for the backend, React.js (JavaScript) for the frontend, and SQLite for database management. The application consists of two main pages: the Input Form page, where users can submit a URL request, and the Share page, where detailed information about the submitted URL request is presented along with a shareable link.
